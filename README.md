# Space Game

Like many of my other early projects, I first started coding Space Game because I wanted to see how far I could go with my new coding skills. It turned out I could not do much, but with the help of Google and several  tutorial videos I was able to make my first game in an actual language. Modeled after Galaga and Space Invaders my game is a very simple arcade style space shooter in which the player controls a spaceship tasked with destroying incoming aliens. 

After spending several days on this project in high school I let it fall to the waste side as I learned easier ways to code games such as Unity. Originally the game consisted of a main menu, the actual game and a game over screen. For actual game play the player would move around and shot incoming aliens to progress to the next level where more enemies would spawn. Recently though I decided to go through and update the game. Most notably I added an ammo restriction, aid packs, and the whole settings page. In order to add a settings page I added music and sound effects as well as a way to change the size of the game window. In addition I worked to better organize my code and improve the run time of the game. While I might of had a working game back in high school the game is now on a completely different level.
